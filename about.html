    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <h2>Welcome to Ankit Speak!</h2>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Ankit, a passionate storyteller dedicated to weaving spine-chilling tales that captivate and entertain. 
        My journey into the world of horror storytelling began at a young age, fueled by a love for suspenseful narratives and the thrill of the unknown.
    </p>

    <h2>My Background</h2>
    <p>
        Growing up, I was always fascinated by ghost stories and urban legends. I started writing my own tales as a way to channel my creativity and share the eerie experiences that intrigued me. 
        Over the years, Iâ€™ve developed a unique style that blends elements of mystery, horror, and a touch of the supernatural.
    </p>

    <h2>Writing Style</h2>
    <p>
        My writing is characterized by vivid imagery, rich character development, and unpredictable plot twists. 
        I aim to create an immersive experience for my readers, drawing them into a world where every shadow holds a secret. 
        When I'm not writing, I love to read horror novels and explore the eerie landscapes that inspire my stories.
    </p>
